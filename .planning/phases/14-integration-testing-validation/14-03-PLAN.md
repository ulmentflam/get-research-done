<objective>
Execute behavioral validation workflows to close verification gaps SC-1, SC-2, and SC-3.

Purpose: The verification revealed that Phase 14's validation infrastructure (checklist, scripts) was created but the actual workflows were never executed. Success criteria require observable behaviors ("works", "proceeds", "triggers warning"), not just structural correctness. This plan executes the 3 workflow paths with a human invoking GRD commands and observing results.

Output:
- Evidence that progressive path (quick -> full -> architect) works
- Evidence that insights path works without warning
- Evidence that quick-only path triggers architect warning
- Updated VALIDATION_RESULTS.md with execution evidence

  <action>
Prepare clean test environment for workflow validation:

1. Back up any existing .planning/DATA_REPORT.md, INSIGHTS_SUMMARY.md, OBJECTIVE.md (if they exist from prior experiments):
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project
   mkdir -p .planning/backup-14-03
   for f in DATA_REPORT.md INSIGHTS_SUMMARY.md OBJECTIVE.md; do
     [ -f ".planning/$f" ] && cp ".planning/$f" ".planning/backup-14-03/$f"
   done
   ```

2. Remove any existing workflow outputs to ensure clean slate:
   ```bash
   rm -f .planning/DATA_REPORT.md .planning/INSIGHTS_SUMMARY.md .planning/OBJECTIVE.md
   ```

3. Verify test data exists:
   ```bash
   test -f .planning/test-data/sample.csv && echo "Test data ready" || echo "ERROR: Missing test data"
   ```

4. Verify PROJECT.md exists (required for GRD commands):
   ```bash
   test -f .planning/PROJECT.md && echo "PROJECT.md ready" || echo "ERROR: Missing PROJECT.md"
   ```

This ensures each workflow validation starts from a known clean state.

  <name>Task 2: Execute SC-1 Progressive Exploration Path</name>
  <what>
    Execute the progressive exploration workflow to validate SC-1:
    "Progressive path works: quick-explore -> full explore -> architect proceeds without error"
  </what>
  <why-human>
    GRD commands (/grd:quick-explore, /grd:explore, /grd:architect) must be invoked by a human user
    in Claude Code. The executor cannot programmatically invoke these slash commands.
  </why-human>
  <instructions>
**Workflow to execute (copy commands exactly):**

**Step 1: Run Quick Explore**
```
/grd:quick-explore .planning/test-data/sample.csv
```
- Wait for command to complete
- Observe Rich console output displays (sparklines, tables, TL;DR)
- Note: DATA_REPORT.md should now have "Quick Explore Mode" header

**Step 2: Verify Quick Mode Header**
```bash
./scripts/verify-quick-mode.sh
```
- Expected: "PASS: Quick Explore header found"

**Step 3: Run Full Explore**
```
/grd:explore .planning/test-data/sample.csv
```
- Wait for full profiling to complete
- This OVERWRITES the Quick mode DATA_REPORT.md with comprehensive profiling

**Step 4: Verify No Longer Quick Mode**
```bash
./scripts/verify-quick-mode.sh
```
- Expected: "FAIL: Quick Explore header not found" (this is correct - full mode replaces quick header)

**Step 5: Run Architect**
```
/grd:architect
```
- Wait for hypothesis generation
- **CRITICAL:** Observe output for any warning about data depth
- Expected: Architect proceeds WITHOUT warning about "quick explore" or insufficient data
- OBJECTIVE.md should be created with testable hypothesis

**Step 6: Verify OBJECTIVE.md Created**
```bash
test -f .planning/OBJECTIVE.md && grep -qi "Falsification" .planning/OBJECTIVE.md && echo "PASS: OBJECTIVE.md with hypothesis"
```
  </instructions>
  <evidence-to-capture>
    1. Did quick-explore complete without error? (yes/no)
    2. Did verify-quick-mode.sh PASS after quick-explore? (yes/no)
    3. Did full explore complete without error? (yes/no)
    4. Did verify-quick-mode.sh FAIL after full explore? (yes/no - FAIL is expected)
    5. Did architect proceed WITHOUT warning about data depth? (yes/no)
    6. Was OBJECTIVE.md created with hypothesis? (yes/no)

  <why-human>
    GRD commands (/grd:insights, /grd:architect) must be invoked by a human user.
  </why-human>
  <instructions>
**First, reset to clean state:**
```bash
rm -f .planning/DATA_REPORT.md .planning/INSIGHTS_SUMMARY.md .planning/OBJECTIVE.md
```

**Workflow to execute:**

**Step 1: Run Insights**
```
/grd:insights .planning/test-data/sample.csv
```
- Wait for command to complete
- Observe Rich console output with plain English insights
- Both DATA_REPORT.md (technical) and INSIGHTS_SUMMARY.md (plain English) should be created

**Step 2: Verify Insights Mode Files**
```bash
./scripts/verify-insights-mode.sh
```
- Expected: "PASS: DATA_REPORT.md exists", "PASS: INSIGHTS_SUMMARY.md exists"

**Step 3: Check INSIGHTS_SUMMARY.md Content**
```bash
grep -c "TL;DR\|5 Things to Know\|What This Means" .planning/INSIGHTS_SUMMARY.md
```
- Expected: Multiple matches (plain English sections present)

**Step 4: Run Architect**
```
/grd:architect
```
- Wait for hypothesis generation
- **CRITICAL:** Observe output - should NOT warn about insufficient data
- Insights mode produces full DATA_REPORT.md, so architect should proceed normally

**Step 5: Verify OBJECTIVE.md Created**
```bash
test -f .planning/OBJECTIVE.md && echo "PASS: OBJECTIVE.md created"
```
  </instructions>
  <evidence-to-capture>
    1. Did insights command complete without error? (yes/no)
    2. Did verify-insights-mode.sh show both files exist? (yes/no)
    3. Does INSIGHTS_SUMMARY.md have TL;DR and plain English sections? (yes/no)
    4. Did architect proceed WITHOUT warning about data depth? (yes/no)
    5. Was OBJECTIVE.md created? (yes/no)

  </what>
  <why-human>
    GRD commands must be invoked by human. Architect warning display is runtime behavior
    that must be observed by human.
  </why-human>
  <instructions>
**First, reset to clean state:**
```bash
rm -f .planning/DATA_REPORT.md .planning/INSIGHTS_SUMMARY.md .planning/OBJECTIVE.md

**Workflow to execute:**

**Step 1: Run ONLY Quick Explore (do NOT run full explore)**
```
/grd:quick-explore .planning/test-data/sample.csv
```
- Wait for command to complete

**Step 2: Verify Quick Mode Header Present**
```bash
./scripts/verify-quick-mode.sh
```
- Expected: "PASS: Quick Explore header found"

**Step 3: Run Architect (WITHOUT full explore)**
```
/grd:architect
```
- **CRITICAL:** Watch the architect output carefully for a WARNING message
- Expected warning patterns to look for:
  - "Quick Explore" mentioned in context of being insufficient
  - Recommendation to run full `/grd:explore`
  - Note about limited data depth or reconnaissance
- Architect should still proceed with hypothesis but user should be warned

**Step 4: Verify Warning Was Displayed**
- Did architect output contain a warning about quick-explore data? (yes/no)
- Copy the exact warning text if possible

**Step 5: Verify OBJECTIVE.md Still Created**
```bash
test -f .planning/OBJECTIVE.md && echo "PASS: OBJECTIVE.md created despite warning"
```
- Architect should proceed (with warning), not fail

  <evidence-to-capture>
    1. Did quick-explore complete without error? (yes/no)
    2. Did verify-quick-mode.sh PASS? (yes/no)
    3. Did architect display a WARNING about quick-explore data? (yes/no) - THIS IS THE KEY TEST
    4. Copy exact warning text if displayed: [text]
    5. Was OBJECTIVE.md still created (architect proceeded)? (yes/no)

Based on checkpoint results from Tasks 2-4, update VALIDATION_RESULTS.md:

1. Read the existing VALIDATION_RESULTS.md

2. Update the Manual Verification Status table:
   - SC-1: Change from "[ ] Not run" to "[x] Pass" or "[!] Fail" based on Task 2 result
   - SC-2: Change from "[ ] Not run" to "[x] Pass" or "[!] Fail" based on Task 3 result
   - SC-3: Change from "[ ] Not run" to "[x] Pass" or "[!] Fail" based on Task 4 result

3. Add new section "## Behavioral Validation Evidence" with:
   - Execution date/time
   - For each scenario: steps executed, observations, pass/fail

4. Update Summary section:
   - Change "Manual checks: Pending user execution" to actual results
   - Add overall validation status

5. If all 5 success criteria now pass (SC-1 through SC-5):
   - Add "## Phase 14 Complete" section
