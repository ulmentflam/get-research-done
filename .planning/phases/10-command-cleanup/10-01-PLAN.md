<objective>
Remove duplicate command files and deprecated GSD-specific commands, updating help documentation to reflect the clean baseline.

Purpose: Establish clean foundation for v1.1 features by clearing accumulated file system debt (macOS sync duplicates) and removing GSD-specific commands that don't apply to the research workflow.

Output: Clean command directory with 30 files (down from 64), updated help.md

    Delete all 32 duplicate " 2.md" files from the commands directory.

    These files were created by macOS file system during sync/copy operations.
    They are exact duplicates of the original command files.

    Steps:
    1. Verify current file count is 64 before deletion
    2. Use Bash rm with quoted paths (files have spaces in names)
    3. Delete each file explicitly (no wildcards for safety)
    4. Verify 32 files were deleted

    IMPORTANT: Quote all file paths - the space before "2.md" requires proper escaping.
    Use: rm ".claude/commands/grd/add-phase 2.md" (not unquoted)
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run: find .claude/commands/grd -name "* 2.md" -type f | wc -l
    Expected: 0 (no duplicate files remain)

    Run: ls -1 .claude/commands/grd/*.md | wc -l
    Expected: 32 (64 - 32 duplicates = 32, before deprecated removal)
  </verify>
  <done>
    All 32 duplicate " 2.md" files deleted. No files with " 2.md" suffix remain in commands directory.
  </done>

    Remove GSD-specific commands that don't apply to research workflow, and update help.md atomically.

    Part A - Delete deprecated commands:
    1. Delete .claude/commands/grd/audit-milestone.md
    2. Delete .claude/commands/grd/plan-milestone-gaps.md

    Part B - Update help.md:
    1. Remove the "### Milestone Auditing" section (lines ~283-303) containing:
       - /grd:audit-milestone command documentation
       - /grd:plan-milestone-gaps command documentation
    2. Keep all other sections intact
    3. No other references to these commands exist in help.md

    The Milestone Auditing section to remove is:
    ```
    ### Milestone Auditing

    **`/grd:audit-milestone [version]`**
    Audit milestone completion against original intent.
    ...

    **`/grd:plan-milestone-gaps`**
    Create phases to close gaps identified by audit.
    ...
    ```
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run: ls .claude/commands/grd/audit-milestone.md 2>&1
    Expected: "No such file or directory"

    Run: ls .claude/commands/grd/plan-milestone-gaps.md 2>&1
    Expected: "No such file or directory"

    Run: grep -c "audit-milestone\|plan-milestone-gaps" .claude/commands/grd/help.md
    Expected: 0 (no references remain)

    Run: ls -1 .claude/commands/grd/*.md | wc -l
    Expected: 30 (final count)
  </verify>
  <done>
    - audit-milestone.md deleted
    - plan-milestone-gaps.md deleted
    - help.md updated with "Milestone Auditing" section removed
    - Final file count is 30 commands
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

After both tasks complete, verify phase success criteria:

1. File count verification:
   ```bash
   ls -1 .claude/commands/grd/*.md | wc -l
   ```
   Expected: 30

2. No duplicate files:
   ```bash
   find .claude/commands/grd -name "* 2.md" -type f
   ```
   Expected: No output (empty)

3. Deprecated commands removed:
   ```bash
   ls .claude/commands/grd/audit-milestone.md .claude/commands/grd/plan-milestone-gaps.md 2>&1
   ```
   Expected: Both return "No such file or directory"

4. Documentation clean:
   ```bash
   grep -E "audit-milestone|plan-milestone-gaps" .claude/commands/grd/help.md
   ```
   Expected: No output (no matches)
