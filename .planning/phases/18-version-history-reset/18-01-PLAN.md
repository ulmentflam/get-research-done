<objective>
Reset external-facing documentation to present GRD as a clean product.

Purpose: Users see GRD as a standalone product with clear capabilities, not as a continuation of GSD version history. External artifacts (CHANGELOG, README, package.json) present professional product positioning.

Output: Fresh CHANGELOG.md with GRD 1.2.0 entry, README.md with GSD acknowledgment footer, package.json with enhanced description and keywords.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Reset CHANGELOG.md with fresh GRD history</name>
  <files>CHANGELOG.md</files>
  <action>
Replace entire CHANGELOG.md with fresh GRD changelog following Keep a Changelog format:

1. Header: "All notable changes to GRD will be documented in this file"
2. Format reference: Link to keepachangelog.com
3. [Unreleased] section (empty)
4. [1.2.0] - 2026-02-02 section with Added items:
   - Recursive validation loop with Critic agent for automated skeptical review
   - Data-first philosophy with Explorer agent for data reconnaissance
   - Hypothesis synthesis with Architect agent for testable experiment design
   - Human-in-the-loop evaluation gates for final validation decisions
   - Notebook graduation workflow for production script conversion
   - Multi-runtime support (Claude Code, OpenCode)

5. Footer links pointing to `ulmentflam/get-research-done`:
   - [Unreleased]: compare/v1.2.0...HEAD
   - [1.2.0]: releases/tag/v1.2.0

Do NOT include any GSD-era changelog entries. Complete reset.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `head -20 CHANGELOG.md` shows GRD header and 1.2.0 entry
2. `grep -c "GSD\|gsd:" CHANGELOG.md` returns 0
3. `grep "ulmentflam/get-research-done" CHANGELOG.md` shows correct repository links
4. `wc -l CHANGELOG.md` shows reasonable line count (< 50 lines)
  </verify>
  <done>CHANGELOG.md contains only GRD 1.2.0 entry with no GSD history, correct repository links</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add GSD acknowledgment to README footer</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Add understated GSD framework acknowledgment to README.md footer.

1. Locate the existing footer section (after License, currently ends with centered tagline)
2. Add GSD acknowledgment below the existing tagline using small text:

```markdown
<sub>Built on the [GSD framework](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done)</sub>
```

The footer should look like:
```markdown
---

<div align="center">

**Claude Code is powerful. GRD makes ML research systematic.**

<sub>Built on the [GSD framework](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done)</sub>

</div>
```

Do NOT modify any other part of the README. This is the only change.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `tail -10 README.md` shows GSD acknowledgment in footer
2. `grep -c "Built on the" README.md` returns 1 (only in footer)
3. `grep -c "glittercowboy" README.md` returns 1 (only in footer acknowledgment)
  </verify>
  <done>README.md footer contains understated "Built on the GSD framework" acknowledgment with link</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update package.json metadata</name>
  <files>package.json</files>
  <action>
Update package.json description and keywords to better describe GRD capabilities:

1. Update description to be more descriptive:
   - Current: "A recursive, agentic framework for ML research with hypothesis-driven experimentation for Claude Code by Ulmentflam."
   - New: "A recursive, agentic framework for ML research with hypothesis-driven experimentation. Features Critic agent for automated skeptical review, Explorer for data reconnaissance, and Architect for hypothesis synthesis."

2. Update keywords array to improve npm discoverability:
   - Keep: "claude", "claude-code", "ai", "research", "ml", "machine-learning", "hypothesis-driven"
   - Add: "data-science", "experiment-tracking", "reproducibility"
   - Remove: "meta-prompting", "context-engineering" (too technical/jargon-y for discovery)

Preserve all other fields (name, version, bin, files, repository, etc.) exactly as-is.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `node -e "console.log(require('./package.json').description)"` shows updated description
2. `node -e "console.log(require('./package.json').keywords)"` shows updated keywords array
3. `node -e "require('./package.json')"` succeeds (valid JSON)
4. `node -e "console.log(require('./package.json').version)"` returns "1.2.0" (unchanged)
  </verify>
  <done>package.json has enhanced description mentioning agents and updated keywords for discoverability</done>
</task>

</tasks>

After all tasks complete:

1. CHANGELOG verification:
   ```bash
   grep -c "GSD\|gsd:" CHANGELOG.md  # Should return 0
   grep "1.2.0" CHANGELOG.md  # Should show version entry
   ```

2. README verification:
   ```bash
   grep "Built on the" README.md  # Should show footer only
   grep -c "GSD\|gsd:" README.md  # Should return 1 (footer only)
   ```

3. package.json verification:
   ```bash
   node -e "require('./package.json')"  # Valid JSON
   ```

4. Cross-file consistency:
   - CHANGELOG version (1.2.0) matches package.json version (1.2.0)
   - All repository links point to ulmentflam/get-research-done
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. CHANGELOG.md presents GRD as fresh 1.2.0 product with no GSD history
2. README.md has understated GSD acknowledgment in footer only
3. package.json has enhanced description and keywords
4. No GSD references in README body or CHANGELOG
5. All external-facing documentation positions GRD as standalone product
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/18-version-history-reset/18-01-SUMMARY.md`
