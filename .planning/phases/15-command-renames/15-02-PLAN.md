<objective>
Rename verification and research commands to experiment/research terminology.

Purpose: These commands support the core workflow with validation and research capabilities. Renaming them aligns the supporting commands with the experiment-centric terminology.

Output: Three renamed commands with all cross-references updated across the codebase.

    Execute atomic rename for verify-work:

    1. Rename files in BOTH directories:
       - mv .claude/commands/grd/verify-work.md .claude/commands/grd/validate-results.md
       - mv commands/grd/verify-work.md commands/grd/validate-results.md

    2. Update frontmatter name field in BOTH renamed files:
       - Change `name: grd:verify-work` to `name: grd:validate-results`
       - Update description to reflect "results" terminology (e.g., "Validate experiment results through conversational UAT")

    3. Update ALL cross-references in ALL .md files under .claude/, commands/, get-research-done/:
       - Replace `/grd:verify-work` with `/grd:validate-results` everywhere

    4. Verify no orphan references remain (excluding .planning/phases/ historical docs)

    IMPORTANT: Skip .planning/phases/ directory when updating references - these are historical records.

    Execute atomic rename for research-phase:

    Per CONTEXT.md, keep "literature-review" as a noun phrase - this is a research convention worth preserving.

    1. Rename files in BOTH directories:
       - mv .claude/commands/grd/research-phase.md .claude/commands/grd/literature-review.md
       - mv commands/grd/research-phase.md commands/grd/literature-review.md

       - Change `name: grd:research-phase` to `name: grd:literature-review`
       - Update description to reflect research terminology (e.g., "Comprehensive ecosystem research for niche/complex domains")

    3. Update ALL cross-references in ALL .md files under .claude/, commands/, get-research-done/:

    Execute atomic rename for list-phase-assumptions:

    Per CONTEXT.md and RESEARCH.md, keep "list-experiment-assumptions" (not shortened to "list-assumptions") for consistency with other experiment-prefixed commands.

    1. Rename files in BOTH directories:

       - Update description to reflect "experiment" terminology (e.g., "See what Claude is planning to do for an experiment")

    3. Update ALL cross-references in ALL .md files under .claude/, commands/, get-research-done/:

After all three renames are complete:

1. Command files exist in both directories:
   - ls .claude/commands/grd/{validate-results,literature-review,list-experiment-assumptions}.md
   - ls commands/grd/{validate-results,literature-review,list-experiment-assumptions}.md

2. Old command files are gone:
   - ls .claude/commands/grd/{verify-work,research-phase,list-phase-assumptions}.md should fail
   - ls commands/grd/{verify-work,research-phase,list-phase-assumptions}.md should fail

3. No orphan references in active code (excluding historical .planning/phases/ docs):
   - grep -r "verify-work\|research-phase\|list-phase-assumptions" .claude/ commands/ get-research-done/ --include="*.md" | wc -l = 0

4. Frontmatter is correct in all renamed files:
   - grep "name: grd:validate-results" .claude/commands/grd/validate-results.md
   - grep "name: grd:literature-review" .claude/commands/grd/literature-review.md
   - grep "name: grd:list-experiment-assumptions" .claude/commands/grd/list-experiment-assumptions.md
