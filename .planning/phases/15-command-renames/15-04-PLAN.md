<objective>
Verify and finalize help.md with experiment terminology.

Purpose: The help.md file is the user's primary reference. It must accurately reflect all renamed commands with correct descriptions and consistent experiment terminology throughout.

Output: Updated help.md files that show all renamed commands with appropriate descriptions.

  <name>Task 1: Verify and update help.md with experiment terminology</name>
  <files>
    .claude/commands/grd/help.md
    commands/grd/help.md
  </files>
  <action>
    Plans 01-03 performed automated find-and-replace on command references. This task verifies the changes and ensures help.md reads naturally with experiment terminology.

    1. Read the current help.md after Plans 01-03 have completed

    2. Verify all 9 commands are renamed:
       - design-experiment (was plan-phase)
       - run-experiment (was execute-phase)
       - scope-experiment (was discuss-phase)
       - validate-results (was verify-work)
       - literature-review (was research-phase)
       - list-experiment-assumptions (was list-phase-assumptions)
       - add-experiment (was add-phase)
       - insert-experiment (was insert-phase)
       - remove-experiment (was remove-phase)

    3. Update section headings and descriptions for clarity:

       **Phase Planning** section should become **Experiment Planning**:
       - `/grd:scope-experiment <number>` - Capture your vision for an experiment before planning
       - `/grd:literature-review <number>` - Comprehensive ecosystem research for niche/complex domains
       - `/grd:list-experiment-assumptions <number>` - See what Claude is planning to do for an experiment
       - `/grd:design-experiment <number>` - Create detailed execution plan for an experiment

       **Execution** section:
       - `/grd:run-experiment <experiment-number>` - Execute all plans in an experiment

       **Roadmap Management** section should become **Study Management** (experiment-level commands):
       - `/grd:add-experiment <description>` - Add new experiment to end of current study
       - `/grd:insert-experiment <after> <description>` - Insert urgent experiment between existing experiments
       - `/grd:remove-experiment <number>` - Remove a future experiment and renumber subsequent experiments

       **User Acceptance Testing** section:
       - `/grd:validate-results [experiment]` - Validate experiment results through conversational UAT

    4. Update Quick Start section:
       ```
       1. `/grd:new-project` - Initialize project
       2. `/grd:design-experiment 1` - Create detailed plan for first experiment
       3. `/grd:run-experiment 1` - Execute the experiment
       ```

    5. Update Core Workflow diagram:
       ```
       /grd:new-project -> /grd:design-experiment -> /grd:run-experiment -> repeat
       ```

    6. Update Common Workflows examples:
       - Starting a new project should reference design-experiment and run-experiment
       - Adding urgent mid-study work should reference insert-experiment

    7. Update any remaining "phase" terminology in prose to "experiment" where it refers to commands:
       - "plan for first phase" -> "plan for first experiment"
       - "Execute the phase" -> "Execute the experiment"
       - "mid-study work" is fine (already uses study terminology)

    8. Ensure BOTH help.md files are identical:
       - .claude/commands/grd/help.md
       - commands/grd/help.md

    Per CONTEXT.md: No mention of old command names. Clean break. No "formerly known as" references.

    - All 9 renamed commands appear in help.md with correct names

  <name>Task 2: Final verification of all Phase 15 renames</name>
  <files>
    All .claude/ and commands/ markdown files
  </files>
  <action>
    Comprehensive verification that all 9 command renames are complete across the entire codebase.

    1. Verify old command files no longer exist:
       ```bash
       ls .claude/commands/grd/{plan-phase,execute-phase,discuss-phase,verify-work,research-phase,list-phase-assumptions,add-phase,insert-phase,remove-phase}.md 2>&1
       # Should all fail with "No such file or directory"
       ```

    2. Verify new command files exist:
       ```bash
       ls .claude/commands/grd/{design-experiment,run-experiment,scope-experiment,validate-results,literature-review,list-experiment-assumptions,add-experiment,insert-experiment,remove-experiment}.md
       # Should all succeed
       ```

    3. Verify mirror directory matches:
       ```bash
       ls commands/grd/{design-experiment,run-experiment,scope-experiment,validate-results,literature-review,list-experiment-assumptions,add-experiment,insert-experiment,remove-experiment}.md
       # Should all succeed
       ```

    4. Verify no orphan references in active system files:
       ```bash
       grep -r "plan-phase\|execute-phase\|discuss-phase\|verify-work\|research-phase\|list-phase-assumptions\|add-phase\|insert-phase\|remove-phase" \
         .claude/ commands/ get-research-done/ \
         --include="*.md" | wc -l
       # Should be 0
       ```

    5. Verify frontmatter is correct in all renamed commands:
       ```bash
       grep "^name: grd:" .claude/commands/grd/{design-experiment,run-experiment,scope-experiment,validate-results,literature-review,list-experiment-assumptions,add-experiment,insert-experiment,remove-experiment}.md
       # Should show 9 lines with correct names
       ```

    6. If any orphan references found, fix them.

    7. Create final verification report in the SUMMARY.
  </action>
  <verify>
    All verification commands in step 1-5 pass as expected.
  </verify>
  <done>
    - All 9 old command files removed
    - All 9 new command files exist (both directories)
    - All frontmatter name fields correct
    - Zero orphan references in active code
    - Phase 15 requirements RENAME-01 through RENAME-09 complete
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

2. Success criteria from ROADMAP.md:
   - User can run all 9 renamed commands and each produces expected output
   - The help command shows all new experiment-based command names with correct descriptions

3. No old terminology in active system files (excluding .planning/phases/ historical docs)
