# Phase 13: Accessible Insights Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Generate plain English data insights for business analyst audience without code or jargon
**Verified:** 2026-02-01T13:24:00Z
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | User can run `/grd:insights <dataset>` to generate business-friendly EDA report | VERIFIED | insights.md command file exists (239 lines), spawns grd-explorer with insights mode context, documented in help.md |
| 2 | Full technical DATA_REPORT.md is saved to file (same rigor as regular explore) | VERIFIED | data_report.md.j2 template (117 lines), generate_insights() writes to output_dir/DATA_REPORT.md, end-to-end test confirmed |
| 3 | Plain English summary is displayed where every statistic includes "What This Means" explanation | VERIFIED | insights_summary.md.j2 has "What This Means" column in Data Overview table, explain_row_count/explain_column_count/explain_missing/explain_memory helpers, test output shows explanations |
| 4 | Actionable recommendations based on data characteristics appear in summary | VERIFIED | generate_recommendations() creates priority-sorted recommendations with code examples, template renders recommendations section with ```python code blocks |
| 5 | LLM prompts for further exploration are provided as copy-paste ready suggestions | VERIFIED | generate_llm_prompts() generates 3-5 contextual prompts, "Dig Deeper" section in template with copyable code blocks |

**Score:** 5/5 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `.claude/get-research-done/lib/insights.py` | Insight generation orchestrator with generate_insights() | EXISTS + SUBSTANTIVE (759 lines) + WIRED | Has generate_insights(), identify_critical_issues(), generate_recommendations(), generate_llm_prompts(), STAT_TRANSLATIONS, explanation helpers. Imports from quick.py and formatters.py. |
| `.claude/get-research-done/lib/templates/insights_summary.md.j2` | Plain English summary template | EXISTS + SUBSTANTIVE (156 lines) | Has TL;DR, "5 Things to Know", "What This Means" table column, Critical Issues, Recommendations, "Dig Deeper" LLM prompts |
| `.claude/get-research-done/lib/templates/data_report.md.j2` | Technical report template | EXISTS + SUBSTANTIVE (117 lines) | Has Data Overview, Column Summary, Missing Data Analysis, Data Quality Issues, Numeric/Categorical stats, Leakage Analysis, "Generated by GRD Insights" branding |
| `.claude/commands/grd/insights.md` | Insights command orchestration | EXISTS + SUBSTANTIVE (239 lines) | Has proper frontmatter (grd:insights), spawns grd-explorer with profiling_mode: insights, includes arguments and examples |
| `.claude/agents/grd-explorer.md` | Explorer agent with insights mode support | EXISTS + UPDATED | Has insights mode detection regex (line 112), Insights Mode Path section (lines 510-537), imports generate_insights from insights.py |
| `.claude/commands/grd/help.md` | Help documentation with insights command | EXISTS + UPDATED | Has /grd:insights in Data Exploration table (line 132), dedicated section with features/usage (lines 148-180), progressive exploration path documented |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|-----|-----|--------|---------|
| insights.md | grd-explorer.md | Task spawn with profiling_mode: insights | WIRED | Line 92: "Spawn grd-explorer agent with insights mode context", Line 155: subagent_type="grd-explorer" |
| grd-explorer.md | insights.py | Import and call generate_insights() | WIRED | Line 522: "from insights import generate_insights", Line 525: "generate_insights(df, target_col=target_column, output_dir='.planning')" |
| insights.py | templates/*.j2 | Jinja2 Environment.get_template() | WIRED | Lines 702-706: Environment with FileSystemLoader, Line 714: env.get_template('data_report.md.j2'), Line 725: env.get_template('insights_summary.md.j2') |
| insights.py | quick.py | Import analysis functions | WIRED | Lines 23-27: from quick import detect_leakage_quick, generate_suggestions |

### Requirements Coverage

Based on ROADMAP.md requirements for Phase 13:

| Requirement | Status | Supporting Evidence |
|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| INSIGHT-01: Plain English insights command | SATISFIED | /grd:insights command exists and documented |
| INSIGHT-02: Technical report saved | SATISFIED | DATA_REPORT.md generated via template |
| INSIGHT-03: "What This Means" explanations | SATISFIED | Table column + explanation helpers |
| INSIGHT-04: Actionable recommendations | SATISFIED | generate_recommendations() with code examples |
| INSIGHT-05: LLM prompts provided | SATISFIED | generate_llm_prompts() + "Dig Deeper" section |

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| None | - | - | - | No anti-patterns detected |

End-to-end test ran successfully:
- Both output files created (DATA_REPORT.md, INSIGHTS_SUMMARY.md)
- TL;DR section present and populated
- "What This Means" explanations present
- Critical issues detected (constant_col, missing_col)
- Code examples in recommendations
- LLM prompts generated with dataset context

### Human Verification Required

None required. All success criteria are programmatically verifiable and have been confirmed via:
1. Import verification (all functions export correctly)
2. Template structure verification (required sections present)
3. End-to-end test with sample data (both outputs generated, content checks passed)

## Summary

Phase 13 goal achieved. All 5 success criteria verified:

1. **Command exists:** `/grd:insights` command created with proper orchestration
2. **Technical report saved:** DATA_REPORT.md generated with full statistics via Jinja2 template
3. **Plain English displayed:** INSIGHTS_SUMMARY.md with "What This Means" explanations for every statistic
4. **Recommendations included:** Actionable recommendations with severity and Python code examples
5. **LLM prompts provided:** 3-5 contextual prompts in "Dig Deeper" section for further exploration

The insights.py module (759 lines) implements a complete narrative generation system using Jinja2 templates with severity-aware language, statistical translations, and contextual LLM prompt generation.
