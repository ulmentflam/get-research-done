<objective>
Rename 6 lifecycle command files from GSD-style to GRD research terminology and update their frontmatter.

Purpose: Create the new command files with correct names so Claude Code recognizes them. This must complete before reference updates (Plan 02) can safely replace old command names.

Output: 6 renamed command files with updated frontmatter, old files removed.

    Update the `name:` field in frontmatter for each renamed file:

    **new-study.md:**
    - Change `name: grd:new-milestone` to `name: grd:new-study`
    - Change description to: "Start a new research study — define scope, research, requirements, roadmap"

    - Change `name: grd:discuss-phase` to `name: grd:scope-study`
    - Change description to: "Scope research approach through adaptive questioning before planning"

    **plan-study.md:**
    - Change `name: grd:plan-phase` to `name: grd:plan-study`
    - Change description to: "Create detailed execution plan for a study (PLAN.md) with verification loop"

    **run-study.md:**
    - Change `name: grd:execute-phase` to `name: grd:run-study`

    Use perl for portable in-place editing:
    ```bash
