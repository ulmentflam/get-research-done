<objective>
Create the OBJECTIVE.md template that structures hypothesis documentation with context, hypothesis statement, success metrics, evaluation methodology, baselines, and falsification criteria.

Purpose: Provide a structured but flexible template for documenting testable hypotheses that the grd-architect agent will populate. The template should be readable by someone unfamiliar with the codebase (self-contained context).

Output: `get-research-done/templates/objective.md` template file

  <name>Task 1: Create OBJECTIVE.md template</name>
  <files>get-research-done/templates/objective.md</files>
  <action>
Create OBJECTIVE.md template following patterns from data-report.md but adapted for hypothesis documentation.

**Template Structure:**

1. **YAML Frontmatter** - Machine-readable metadata for validation:
```yaml
---
created: {{timestamp}}
phase: 3
status: draft  # draft, review, finalized
data_report: {{path_or_null}}

# Hypothesis metadata
hypothesis_id: {{unique_id}}
version: 1

# Success metrics (for validation)
metrics:
  - name: {{metric_name}}
    threshold: {{value}}
    comparison: {{greater_than|less_than}}
    weight: {{0.0-1.0}}

# Evaluation methodology
evaluation:
  strategy: {{k-fold|stratified-k-fold|time-series-split|holdout}}
  k_folds: {{number_or_null}}
  test_size: {{proportion_or_null}}
  random_state: 42

# Baseline status
baseline_defined: {{true|false}}

# Falsification
has_falsification_criteria: {{true|false}}
---
```

2. **Context Section** - Background and motivation (min 50 chars)
   - What problem/question is being addressed
   - Why this hypothesis matters
   - Data characteristics that inform the hypothesis (reference DATA_REPORT.md if available)
   - Known constraints or limitations

3. **Hypothesis Section** - The testable prediction
   - Flexible prose format with required elements:
     - **What:** Clear statement of what is being tested
     - **Why:** Rationale based on data insights or domain knowledge
     - **Expected Outcome:** Predicted result if hypothesis is true
   - NOT rigid null/alternative hypothesis format (per CONTEXT.md)

4. **Success Metrics Section** - How success is measured
   - Table format for metrics:
     | Metric | Threshold | Comparison | Weight |
   - Note: Weights must sum to 1.0
   - Both absolute thresholds and relative improvements allowed

5. **Evaluation Methodology Section** - How hypothesis will be tested
   - Strategy (k-fold CV, stratified k-fold, time-series split, holdout)
   - Parameters (k value, test size proportion, random seed)
   - Justification for chosen methodology
   - Note: Must be defined upfront to prevent p-hacking

6. **Baselines Section** - Comparison points
   - Table format:
     | Baseline | Type | Expected Performance | Citation |
   - Types: own_implementation, literature_citation
   - Placeholder text if baseline not yet defined
   - Note about baseline warning (will be flagged if empty)

7. **Falsification Criteria Section** - What would disprove the hypothesis
   - Table format:
     | Criterion | Metric | Threshold | Type | Explanation |
   - Types: quantitative (preferred), qualitative
   - At least one criterion required
   - Explanation of what falsification means scientifically

8. **Constraints Section** (optional) - Known limitations
   - Data constraints from DATA_REPORT.md
   - Resource constraints
   - Scope boundaries

9. **Non-Goals Section** (optional) - Explicit exclusions
   - What this hypothesis does NOT attempt to prove
   - Out-of-scope considerations

**Template Placeholders:**
Use `{{placeholder}}` syntax for values the agent will populate.
Include helpful comments with `<!-- ... -->` for guidance.

**Follow data-report.md patterns:**
- Clear section headers with ##
- Tables for structured data
- Severity/status indicators where appropriate
- Timestamp and metadata at top

File exists: `ls get-research-done/templates/objective.md`

OBJECTIVE.md template exists with:
- YAML frontmatter with metrics, evaluation, baseline_defined, has_falsification_criteria
- Context section (background, motivation, constraints)
- Hypothesis section (what, why, expected outcome - prose format)
- Success Metrics section (table with weight validation note)
- Evaluation Methodology section (strategy, parameters, justification)
- Baselines section (table with warning note)
- Falsification Criteria section (table with at least one criterion required)
- Optional Constraints and Non-Goals sections
  </done>

<verification>
- [ ] Template file exists at get-research-done/templates/objective.md
- [ ] YAML frontmatter is valid (can be parsed)
- [ ] All required sections present (Context, Hypothesis, Success Metrics, Evaluation, Baselines, Falsification)
- [ ] Sections match CONTEXT.md decisions (flexible prose, weighted metrics, evaluation upfront)
- [ ] Template follows data-report.md patterns for consistency
</verification>

<success_criteria>
OBJECTIVE.md template is complete, well-structured, and ready for the grd-architect agent to populate. Template enforces required elements while maintaining flexibility for different hypothesis types.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-hypothesis-synthesis/03-01-SUMMARY.md`
