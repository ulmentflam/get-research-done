<objective>
Update all "Next Up" sections across command files to use "Experiment" terminology instead of "Phase".

Purpose: After any command completes, the suggested next command should use consistent experiment terminology to maintain the research-native workflow experience.

Output: 7 command files updated with "Phase {N}" -> "Experiment {N}" and related terminology changes.

Update "Next Up" sections in these 4 command files:

**add-experiment.md** (line ~169-174):
- "**Phase {N}: {description}**" -> "**Experiment {N}: {description}**"
- Keep `/grd:design-experiment {N}` as-is (already correct)

**insert-experiment.md** (line ~188-193):
- "**Phase {decimal_phase}: {description}** — urgent insertion" -> "**Experiment {decimal_phase}: {description}** — urgent insertion"
- Keep `/grd:design-experiment {decimal_phase}` as-is

**new-project.md** (line ~952-957):
- "**Phase 1: [Phase Name]**" -> "**Experiment 1: [Experiment Name]**"
- Keep `/grd:scope-experiment 1` as-is

**design-experiment.md** (line ~495-500):
- "**Execute Phase {X}**" -> "**Execute Experiment {X}**"
- Keep `/grd:run-experiment {X}` as-is

Each file has a single "Next Up" section to update. Preserve the markdown formatting (horizontal rules, sub text, etc.).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `grep -n "Phase {" commands/grd/add-experiment.md commands/grd/insert-experiment.md commands/grd/new-project.md commands/grd/design-experiment.md`
Expected: Returns nothing (all Phase {N} replaced with Experiment {N}).

Run: `grep -n "Experiment {" commands/grd/add-experiment.md`
Expected: Returns the Next Up section line.
  </verify>
  <done>
All 4 files have "Next Up" sections using "Experiment" terminology. add-experiment.md, insert-experiment.md, new-project.md, and design-experiment.md all reference "Experiment {N}" not "Phase {N}".

  <action>
Update "Next Up" sections in these 3 command files (each has multiple conditional Next Up sections):

**validate-results.md** (has 4 "Next Up" sections):
1. Line ~89-94: "**Phase {Z+1}: {Name}**" -> "**Experiment {Z+1}: {Name}**"
2. Line ~120-125: Already correct ("Audit study")
3. Line ~155-160: Already correct ("Execute fix plans")
4. Line ~190-195: Already correct ("Manual intervention")

**run-experiment.md** (has 3 "Next Up" sections):
1. Line ~161-166: "**Phase {Z+1}: {Name}**" -> "**Experiment {Z+1}: {Name}**"
2. Line ~192-197: Already correct ("Audit study")
3. Line ~227-232: "complete the phase" -> "complete the experiment" (in description text)

**progress.md** (has 7 "Next Up" sections):
1. Line ~161-166: Keep as-is (references {phase}-{plan} which is file naming)
2. Line ~183-188: "**Phase {N}: {Name}**" -> "**Experiment {N}: {Name}**"
3. Line ~200-205: "**Phase {N}: {Name}**" -> "**Experiment {N}: {Name}**"
4. Line ~273-278: "## Phase {Z} Complete" -> "## Experiment {Z} Complete", "**Phase {Z+1}:**" -> "**Experiment {Z+1}:**"
5. Line ~301-306: Already correct ("Complete Study")
6. Line ~332-337: Already correct ("Start Next Study")

For progress.md, also update any section headers that use "Phase" terminology:
- "## Phase {Z} Complete" -> "## Experiment {Z} Complete"
- "All {N} phases finished!" -> "All {N} experiments finished!" (if present)

Preserve all markdown formatting (horizontal rules, code blocks, sub text).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `grep -n "Phase {Z" commands/grd/validate-results.md commands/grd/run-experiment.md commands/grd/progress.md`
Expected: Returns nothing (all Phase {Z+1} replaced).

Run: `grep -c "Experiment {" commands/grd/progress.md`
Expected: Returns 4+ (multiple experiment references).

Run: `grep -n "complete the phase" commands/grd/run-experiment.md`
Expected: Returns nothing (replaced with "complete the experiment").
  </verify>
  <done>
All 3 complex routing files have updated "Next Up" sections using "Experiment" terminology. validate-results.md, run-experiment.md, and progress.md all use "Experiment {N}" format and consistent terminology.
  </done>

After both tasks complete:

1. No Phase {N} patterns remaining in routing:
```bash
grep -rn "Phase {" commands/grd/*.md | grep -v "frontmatter\|argument-hint" | head -20
# Should return nothing or only non-routing contexts
```

2. Experiment terminology used:
```bash
grep -rn "Experiment {" commands/grd/add-experiment.md commands/grd/insert-experiment.md commands/grd/new-project.md commands/grd/design-experiment.md commands/grd/validate-results.md commands/grd/run-experiment.md commands/grd/progress.md | wc -l
# Should return 10+ (multiple instances across files)
```

3. No mixed terminology in Next Up sections:
```bash
grep -A 5 "Next Up" commands/grd/progress.md | grep -c "Phase"
# Should return 0
```
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. All 7 command files have "Next Up" sections using "Experiment" not "Phase"
2. add-experiment.md: "Experiment {N}: {description}"
3. insert-experiment.md: "Experiment {decimal_phase}: {description}"
4. new-project.md: "Experiment 1: [Experiment Name]"
5. design-experiment.md: "Execute Experiment {X}"
6. validate-results.md: "Experiment {Z+1}: {Name}"
7. run-experiment.md: "Experiment {Z+1}: {Name}", "complete the experiment"
8. progress.md: All section headers and routing use "Experiment"
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/17-artifact-updates/17-03-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
