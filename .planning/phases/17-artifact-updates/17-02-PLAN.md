<objective>
Reorganize help.md with categorized command reference and quick-start workflow section showing the new experiment-based terminology.

Purpose: Users running `/grd:help` should see commands organized by purpose with a clear quick-start path using the renamed commands.

Output: Updated help.md with categorized commands and quick-start workflow section.

  <name>Task 1: Add categorized command reference section</name>
  <files>commands/grd/help.md</files>
  <action>
Add a "Commands by Category" section after the existing "Core Workflow" section. Group all 33 commands into these categories per CONTEXT.md and RESEARCH.md:

**Lifecycle Commands (9):**
- new-project - Initialize project with questioning -> research -> requirements -> roadmap
- new-study - Start new research study
- design-experiment - Create detailed plan for experiment
- run-experiment - Execute experiment plans
- validate-results - Test experiment results through UAT
- complete-study - Archive completed study
- audit-study - Audit study against hypotheses
- plan-study-gaps - Create experiments to close audit gaps
- progress - Check status and route to next action

**Research Commands (5):**
- scope-experiment - Capture vision before planning
- literature-review - Comprehensive ecosystem research
- list-experiment-assumptions - See Claude's intended approach
- research - General domain research
- architect - Hypothesis synthesis from data

**Data Commands (3):**
- explore - Data reconnaissance and profiling
- evaluate - Model evaluation with evidence packages
- insights - Plain English data explanations

**Roadmap Management (3):**
- add-experiment - Add experiment to end of study
- insert-experiment - Insert urgent experiment between existing
- remove-experiment - Remove future experiment and renumber

**Session Management (2):**
- pause-work - Create context handoff
- resume-work - Restore previous session

**Quick Mode (2):**
- quick - Execute small ad-hoc tasks
- quick-explore - Fast data exploration

**Todo Management (2):**
- add-todo - Capture idea as todo
- check-todos - List and select todos to work on

**Utility (7):**
- help - Show command reference
- update - Update GRD to latest
- settings - Configure workflow toggles
- set-profile - Switch model profile
- debug - Systematic debugging with persistence
- map-codebase - Map existing codebase
- graduate - Graduate notebook to production

Format each category as a subsection with brief one-line descriptions per command. Use the format:
```markdown
### Lifecycle Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/grd:new-project` | Initialize project with full flow |
| `/grd:design-experiment` | Create detailed experiment plan |
...
```

Place this section BEFORE the detailed command documentation, AFTER "Core Workflow".
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `grep -n "Commands by Category\|Lifecycle Commands\|Research Commands\|Data Commands" commands/grd/help.md`
Expected: Returns line numbers for all category headers.

Run: `grep -c "grd:" commands/grd/help.md`
Expected: Returns high count (33+ commands referenced multiple times).
  </verify>
  <done>
help.md contains "Commands by Category" section with all 33 commands organized into 8 categories (Lifecycle, Research, Data, Roadmap Management, Session Management, Quick Mode, Todo Management, Utility).

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update quick-start workflow section</name>
  <files>commands/grd/help.md</files>
  <action>
Update the "Quick Start" section and "Core Workflow" section to emphasize the research-native flow:

1. Update Quick Start to show complete experiment workflow:
```markdown
## Quick Start

1. `/grd:new-project` - Initialize (questioning -> research -> requirements -> roadmap)
2. `/grd:design-experiment 1` - Plan first experiment
3. `/grd:run-experiment 1` - Execute experiment
4. `/grd:validate-results 1` - Verify results
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for remaining experiments
6. `/grd:complete-study` - Archive study and prepare for next
```

2. Update Core Workflow diagram:
```markdown
## Core Workflow

```
new-project -> design-experiment -> run-experiment -> validate-results -> repeat
                    |                                        |
                    v                                        v
             scope-experiment                         complete-study
             literature-review                           (when done)
```

3. Add a "Common Workflows" section if not present, showing:
- New project flow
- Resume work flow
- Mid-study urgent insertion
- Study completion flow
- Capturing ideas (todos)
- Debugging flow

Ensure all command references use the new names (design-experiment not plan-phase, run-experiment not execute-phase, validate-results not verify-work).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `grep -n "plan-phase\|execute-phase\|verify-work" commands/grd/help.md`
Expected: Returns nothing (old command names removed).

Run: `grep -n "design-experiment.*run-experiment.*validate-results" commands/grd/help.md`
Expected: Returns the workflow line showing correct command sequence.
  </verify>
  <done>
help.md has updated Quick Start showing full experiment workflow (new-project -> design-experiment -> run-experiment -> validate-results -> complete-study), Core Workflow diagram with new command names, and Common Workflows section with practical examples.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

After both tasks complete:

1. No old command names:
```bash
grep -n "plan-phase\|execute-phase\|verify-work\|discuss-phase\|research-phase" commands/grd/help.md
# Should return nothing
```

2. Categories present:
```bash
grep -c "### .*Commands" commands/grd/help.md
# Should return 8 (one per category)
```

3. Quick-start complete:
```bash
grep -A 10 "## Quick Start" commands/grd/help.md | grep -c "grd:"
# Should return 5+ (steps in quick start)
```
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. Commands grouped by category with 8 category headers (Lifecycle, Research, Data, Roadmap Management, Session Management, Quick Mode, Todo Management, Utility)
2. Quick Start shows complete experiment flow with validate-results and complete-study
3. Core Workflow diagram uses new command names
4. No references to old command names (plan-phase, execute-phase, verify-work, discuss-phase, research-phase)
5. All 33 commands appear in at least one category
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/17-artifact-updates/17-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
