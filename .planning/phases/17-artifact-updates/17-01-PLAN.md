<objective>
Update STATE.md and ROADMAP.md templates to use consistent research terminology (experiments, studies) instead of software development terminology (phases, milestones).

Purpose: New projects initialized with `/grd:new-project` should use experiment-based terminology from day one, matching the renamed commands.

Output: Updated template files in `get-research-done/templates/` with all phase -> experiment and milestone -> study replacements.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update STATE.md template terminology</name>
  <files>get-research-done/templates/state.md</files>
  <action>
Update the STATE.md template with the following terminology replacements:

1. Section headers and field names:
   - "Phase: [X] of [Y] ([Phase name])" -> "Experiment: [X] of [Y] ([Experiment name])"
   - "Plan: [A] of [B] in current phase" -> "Plan: [A] of [B] in current experiment"
   - "Phase complete" -> "Experiment complete"
   - "Phase X of Y" -> "Experiment X of Y"
   - "By Phase:" -> "By Experiment:"
   - "| Phase |" -> "| Experiment |"
   - "current phase name" -> "current experiment name"
   - "which phase" -> "which experiment"
   - "which plan within phase" -> "which plan within experiment"
   - "Per-phase breakdown" -> "Per-experiment breakdown"

2. Milestone -> Study replacements (if any):
   - "Milestone History" -> "Research History"
   - Any "milestone" references -> "study"

3. Documentation comments:
   - "Phase 1 ready to plan" -> "Experiment 1 ready to plan"
   - "After phase marked complete" -> "After experiment marked complete"
   - "Next Phase Readiness" -> "Next Experiment Readiness"
   - "originating phase" -> "originating experiment"
   - "affecting future work" -> keep as is

4. Agent phase references:
   - Keep "**Phase:** {{researcher|critic|evaluator|human_review}}" as-is (this refers to research loop phase, not project phase)

Preserve all formatting, structure, and non-terminology content.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `grep -n "Phase\|phase" get-research-done/templates/state.md`
Expected: Only valid uses remain (research loop phase reference, if any). No project phase terminology.

Run: `grep -n "Experiment.*of.*\[Y\]" get-research-done/templates/state.md`
Expected: Returns the Current Position template line.
  </verify>
  <done>
STATE.md template uses "Experiment: [X] of [Y]" format, "By Experiment" section header, and no project-level "Phase" references remain.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update ROADMAP.md template terminology</name>
  <files>get-research-done/templates/roadmap.md</files>
  <action>
Update the ROADMAP.md template with the following terminology replacements:

1. Phase -> Experiment replacements:
   - "**Phase Numbering:**" -> "**Experiment Numbering:**"
   - "Integer phases (1, 2, 3)" -> "Integer experiments (1, 2, 3)"
   - "Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2)" -> "Decimal experiments (2.1, 2.2)"
   - "**Phase 1: [Name]**" -> "**Experiment 1: [Name]**" (all instances)
   - "## Phase Details" -> "## Experiment Details"
   - "### Phase 1: [Name]" -> "### Experiment 1: [Name]" (all instances)
   - "Nothing (first phase)" -> "Nothing (first experiment)"
   - "Depends on: Phase N" -> "Depends on: Experiment N"
   - "Phase 2.1: Critical Fix (INSERTED)" -> "Experiment 2.1: Critical Fix (INSERTED)"
   - "| Phase |" -> "| Experiment |"

2. Milestone -> Study replacements:
   - "Planned milestone work" -> "Planned study work"
   - "milestone" -> "study" where referring to version groups

3. Guidelines section:
   - "Phase count" -> "Experiment count"
   - "Each phase delivers" -> "Each experiment delivers"
   - "{phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md" -> keep as-is (file naming convention)
   - "verify-phase" -> "validate-results" (command was renamed)
   - "phase numbering" -> "experiment numbering"
   - "2-5 observable behaviors per phase" -> "2-5 observable behaviors per experiment"

4. Status values: Keep unchanged (Not started, In progress, Complete, Deferred)

5. Milestone-Grouped Roadmap section:
   - "v1.0 MVP (Phases 1-4)" -> "v1.0 MVP (Experiments 1-4)"
   - "#### Phase 5:" -> "#### Experiment 5:"
   - etc.

Preserve all formatting, markdown structure, and code blocks.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `grep -n "Phase\|phase" get-research-done/templates/roadmap.md`
Expected: Only valid uses remain (file naming convention "{phase}-{plan}" if kept). No project terminology.

Run: `grep -c "Experiment" get-research-done/templates/roadmap.md`
Expected: Returns a count > 20 (many replacements made).
  </verify>
  <done>
ROADMAP.md template uses "Experiment 1:", "Experiment Details", "Experiment Numbering", and all phase -> experiment replacements are complete. Milestone -> study where appropriate.
  </done>
</task>

After both tasks complete:

1. Template terminology consistency:
```bash
grep -rn "Phase.*of.*\[Y\]" get-research-done/templates/
# Should return nothing (old format removed)

grep -rn "Experiment.*of.*\[Y\]" get-research-done/templates/
# Should return state.md line
```

2. No mixed terminology:
```bash
grep -n "phase" get-research-done/templates/state.md | grep -v "{{.*phase" | wc -l
# Should return 0 or very low count (only research loop phase)

grep -n "phase" get-research-done/templates/roadmap.md | grep -v "{phase}" | wc -l
# Should return 0 (only file naming convention allowed)
```
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. STATE.md template tracks "Experiment: [X] of [Y]" (not Phase)
2. ROADMAP.md template uses "Experiment N:" throughout (not Phase N:)
3. No mixed phase/experiment terminology in either template
4. File naming convention ({phase}-{plan}) preserved where needed
5. Research loop "phase" (researcher/critic/evaluator) terminology preserved
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/17-artifact-updates/17-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
