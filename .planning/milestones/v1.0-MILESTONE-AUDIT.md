**Status:** COMPLETE

**Total: 5/5 flows verified (100%)**

## Tech Debt Assessment

### Addressed in v1 Gap Closure Phases

| Item | Priority | Addressed In | Status |
|------|----------|--------------|--------|
| REVISE_DATA Auto-Routing | HIGH | Phase 7 | ✓ Closed |
| STATE.md Update Enforcement | MEDIUM | Phase 7 | ✓ Closed |
| Baseline Experiment Orchestration | LOW | Phase 8 | ✓ Closed |

### Outstanding

**None.** All identified tech debt from Phase 4 verification has been addressed in gap closure phases 7-8.

## Quality Indicators

- **No stub patterns:** All files contain substantive implementations
- **No orphaned exports:** All created functionality is consumed
- **No broken flows:** All user journeys complete end-to-end
- **Consistent wiring:** Commands → Agents → Templates → Python modules connected
- **Proper gating:** Hard gates for critical (OBJECTIVE.md, baselines), soft for optional (DATA_REPORT.md)
- **Full automation:** REVISE_DATA loop requires no manual intervention

## Conclusion

**GRD v1 milestone audit: PASSED**

- ✅ All 25 requirements satisfied (100%)
- ✅ All 9 phases verified (100%)
- ✅ All 23 integrations wired (100%)
- ✅ All 5 E2E flows complete (100%)
- ✅ Zero tech debt remaining

The milestone is ready for completion and tagging.
