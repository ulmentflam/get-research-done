# Requirements: GRD v1.2 Command Unification

**Defined:** 2026-02-01
**Core Value:** Establish GRD as a clean, research-native CLI with experiment-based terminology and fresh version history

## v1.2 Requirements

Requirements for Command Unification milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Command Renames

- [x] **RENAME-01**: Rename `plan-phase` to `design-experiment` (file, content, help.md)
- [x] **RENAME-02**: Rename `execute-phase` to `run-experiment` (file, content, help.md)
- [x] **RENAME-03**: Rename `discuss-phase` to `scope-experiment` (file, content, help.md)
- [x] **RENAME-04**: Rename `verify-work` to `validate-results` (file, content, help.md)
- [x] **RENAME-05**: Rename `research-phase` to `literature-review` (file, content, help.md)
- [x] **RENAME-06**: Rename `list-phase-assumptions` to `list-experiment-assumptions` (file, content, help.md)
- [x] **RENAME-07**: Rename `add-phase` to `add-experiment` (file, content, help.md)
- [x] **RENAME-08**: Rename `insert-phase` to `insert-experiment` (file, content, help.md)
- [x] **RENAME-09**: Rename `remove-phase` to `remove-experiment` (file, content, help.md)

### Command Chaining Fixes

- [x] **CHAIN-01**: Update `new-study` to route to `design-experiment` (not `plan-phase`)
- [x] **CHAIN-02**: Replace all `audit-milestone` references with `audit-study`
- [x] **CHAIN-03**: Replace all `complete-milestone` references with `complete-study`
- [x] **CHAIN-04**: Replace all `new-milestone` references with `new-study`
- [x] **CHAIN-05**: Add explicit route from `evaluate` Seal decision to `graduate`
- [x] **CHAIN-06**: Standardize flag `--gaps-only` to `--gaps` everywhere

### Artifact Updates

- [x] **ARTIFACT-01**: Update STATE.md template to track experiments instead of phases
- [x] **ARTIFACT-02**: Update ROADMAP.md terminology (phase -> experiment, milestone -> study)
- [x] **ARTIFACT-03**: Update help.md with complete new command reference
- [x] **ARTIFACT-04**: Update all "Next Up" sections across all 33 command files

### Version History Reset

- [x] **VERSION-01**: Reset PROJECT.md - remove v1.0/v1.1 references, start fresh as GRD 1.0
  - **Outcome:** Scoped to external docs only (CHANGELOG.md reset instead)
- [x] **VERSION-02**: Reset STATE.md - clear milestone history table, reset to clean GRD state
  - **Outcome:** Scoped to external docs only (internal STATE.md kept for context)
- [x] **VERSION-03**: Archive or remove MILESTONES.md - GSD-era history not relevant to GRD
  - **Outcome:** Scoped to external docs only (internal MILESTONES.md kept)
- [x] **VERSION-04**: Update package.json version to reflect GRD 1.0 (not continuation of GSD)
  - **Outcome:** Set to 1.2.0 (continuation version for npm publishing)
- [x] **VERSION-05**: Clean up "Validated" requirements - reframe as GRD baseline, not GSD history
  - **Outcome:** Scoped to external docs only

### Documentation

- [x] **DOC-01**: Update PROJECT.md as clean GRD project document
  - **Outcome:** Scoped out per user decision
- [x] **DOC-02**: Update any inline command references in agent system prompts
  - **Outcome:** User chose to keep some stale refs (documented exceptions)
- [x] **DOC-03**: Verify all command flows work end-to-end
  - **Outcome:** 23/23 integration tests passing

## Future Requirements

Deferred to future milestone. Not in v1.2 scope.

### Potential v2.0 Features

- **FUTURE-01**: MLflow integration for experiment tracking
- **FUTURE-02**: DVC integration for data versioning
- **FUTURE-03**: Multi-user support with shared experiment registry

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded from v1.2. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Backward compatibility aliases | User chose clean break; simpler implementation |
| ROADMAP.md deprecation | User chose keep and update terminology |
| New commands | v1.2 is rename/fix only, no new functionality |
| Agent system prompt renames | Keep grd-* prefixes, only change command names |
| Preserving GSD version history | Clean break - GRD starts fresh at 1.0 |
| Git history rewrite | Keep git commits, just update planning docs |

## Traceability
