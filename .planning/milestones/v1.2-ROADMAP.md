# Milestone v1.2: Command Unification

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-02
**Phases:** 15-19
**Total Plans:** 12

## Overview

Transform all lifecycle commands from software-dev terminology (phases, milestones, roadmaps) to research-native terminology (experiments, studies, protocols) with correct command chaining.

## Phases

### Phase 15: Command Renames

**Goal:** All phase-related commands use experiment terminology consistently
**Depends on:** Phase 14 (v1.1 foundation)
**Plans:** 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 15-01-PLAN.md — Rename core workflow commands (plan-phase, execute-phase, discuss-phase)
- [x] 15-02-PLAN.md — Rename verification and research commands (verify-work, research-phase, list-phase-assumptions)
- [x] 15-03-PLAN.md — Rename roadmap management commands (add-phase, insert-phase, remove-phase)
- [x] 15-04-PLAN.md — Update help.md and final verification

**Details:**
- Renamed 9 commands with full cross-reference updates
- design-experiment, run-experiment, scope-experiment, validate-results, literature-review
- list-experiment-assumptions, add-experiment, insert-experiment, remove-experiment

---

### Phase 16: Command Chaining Fixes

**Goal:** Commands route to each other correctly using new terminology throughout the workflow
**Depends on:** Phase 15
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 16-01-PLAN.md — Replace milestone terminology with study equivalents in routing
- [x] 16-02-PLAN.md — Add evaluate->graduate route for Seal decision and standardize --gaps flag

**Details:**
- new-study → design-experiment routing
- audit-milestone → audit-study, complete-milestone → complete-study
- Evaluate Seal decision → graduate route
- --gaps flag standardization

---

### Phase 17: Artifact Updates

**Goal:** All artifact templates and references use consistent research terminology
**Depends on:** Phase 16
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 17-01-PLAN.md — Update STATE.md and ROADMAP.md templates with experiment terminology
- [x] 17-02-PLAN.md — Reorganize help.md with categorized commands and quick-start workflow
- [x] 17-03-PLAN.md — Update "Next Up" sections across 7 command files

**Details:**
- STATE.md template: "Experiment: [X] of [Y]"
- ROADMAP.md template: "Experiment N:" format, Study groupings
- help.md: 8 categories, 6-step Quick Start workflow

---

### Phase 18: Version History Reset

**Goal:** External documentation presents GRD as a clean product (CHANGELOG, README, package.json)
**Depends on:** Phase 17
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 18-01-PLAN.md — Reset CHANGELOG, add README footer acknowledgment, update package.json metadata

**Details:**
- CHANGELOG.md reset to single v1.2.0 entry (0 GSD references)
- README footer: "Built on the GSD framework" acknowledgment
- package.json: Enhanced description with agent mentions, research-focused keywords

---

### Phase 19: Documentation & Testing

**Goal:** Validate code and agent prompts reflect renamed commands and test command chains end-to-end
**Depends on:** Phases 15-18
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 19-01-PLAN.md — Detect and fix stale command references in agent prompts and workflows
- [x] 19-02-PLAN.md — Create integration test suite for command chain validation

**Details:**
- 23 integration tests validating command existence and chains
- Validation exceptions documented (CHANGELOG.md, .planning/**, agent files)
- npm test script added for continuous validation

---

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**
- None (no urgent insertions needed)

**Key Decisions:**
- Use 'design-experiment' not 'plan-experiment' — emphasizes experimental design
- Use 'run-experiment' not 'execute-experiment' — shorter, more direct
- Use 'scope-experiment' not 'define-experiment' — scope implies boundaries
- No backward compatibility aliases — clean break for v1.2
- External docs only for version reset — internal .planning files kept for context
- Intentional stale references in agent prompts — user decision to defer updates

**Issues Resolved:**
- All 9 command renames completed with 0 orphan references in active code
- Command chain routing fixed — workflows use new terminology
- Template terminology unified across STATE.md and ROADMAP.md

**Issues Deferred:**
- Internal planning files (PROJECT.md, STATE.md, MILESTONES.md) not reset — scoped to external docs
- Agent system prompt updates — intentionally kept per user decision
- GSD workflow files unchanged — GSD executes them, not GRD

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- 5 agent files contain stale command references (grd-planner, grd-executor, grd-roadmapper, grd-debugger)
- GRD-STYLE.md contains execute-phase.md references
- Milestone templates use "milestone" not "study" terminology
