# Milestone v1.1: Research UX Refinement

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-01
**Phases:** 10-14
**Total Plans:** 13

## Overview

Streamlined GRD for research workflows by removing GSD legacy, adding accessible EDA for non-data-scientists, and creating fast exploration paths.

## Phases

### Phase 10: Command Cleanup & Foundation

**Goal**: Remove GSD legacy commands and establish clean baseline for v1.1 features
**Depends on**: Phase 9 (v1.0 complete)
**Requirements**: CLEAN-01, CLEAN-02, CLEAN-03, CLEAN-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 10-01-PLAN.md — Delete duplicates, remove deprecated commands, update help.md
- [x] 10-02-PLAN.md — Restore audit/gap commands with study-centric naming (gap closure)

**Success Criteria:**
1. All 32 duplicate " 2.md" skill files deleted from `.claude/commands/grd/`
2. GSD-specific commands (audit-milestone, plan-milestone-gaps) removed and no longer appear in help
3. Command count reduced from 64 files to 30 unique files
4. Help documentation reflects only research-relevant commands

**Completed:** 2026-01-31

### Phase 11: Terminology Rename

**Goal**: Rename lifecycle commands to match GRD research terminology
**Depends on**: Phase 10
**Requirements**: TERM-01, TERM-02, TERM-03, TERM-04, TERM-05, TERM-06, TERM-07
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 11-01-PLAN.md — Rename 6 command files with git mv, update frontmatter
- [x] 11-02-PLAN.md — Update all internal references to new command names
- [x] 11-03-PLAN.md — Update broader terminology (Phase->Study, Milestone->Version)

**Rename Mapping:**
| Current | New | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| `new-milestone` | `new-study` | Start a new research study |
| `complete-milestone` | `complete-study` | Archive and conclude a study |
| `discuss-phase` | `scope-study` | Scope the research approach |
| `plan-phase` | `plan-study` | Plan the research execution |
| `execute-phase` | `run-study` | Execute the research plan |
| `verify-work` | `validate-study` | Validate research results |

**Completed:** 2026-01-31

### Phase 12: Quick Explore

**Goal**: Enable fast EDA producing summary output for quick data familiarization decisions
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: QUICK-01, QUICK-02, QUICK-03, QUICK-04, QUICK-05
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 12-01-PLAN.md — Create quick-explore command and formatters module
- [x] 12-02-PLAN.md — Create quick.py analysis module and update data-report template
- [x] 12-03-PLAN.md — Integrate quick mode into Explorer/Architect agents and help.md

**Success Criteria:**
1. User can run `/grd:quick-explore <dataset>` and receive analysis in under 60 seconds
2. Quick explore outputs summary statistics to console
3. Distribution patterns highlighted with simple indicators
4. Output is markdown-formatted and copy-paste ready
5. DATA_REPORT.md contains "Quick Explore" mode header

**Completed:** 2026-02-01

### Phase 13: Accessible Insights

**Goal**: Generate plain English data insights for business analyst audience without code or jargon
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Requirements**: INSIGHT-01, INSIGHT-02, INSIGHT-03, INSIGHT-04, INSIGHT-05
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 13-01-PLAN.md — Create Jinja2 templates and insights.py module with narrative generation
- [x] 13-02-PLAN.md — Create /grd:insights command and integrate with Explorer agent

**Success Criteria:**
1. User can run `/grd:insights <dataset>` to generate business-friendly EDA report
2. Full technical DATA_REPORT.md saved to file
3. Plain English summary with "What This Means" explanations
4. Actionable recommendations based on data characteristics
5. LLM prompts for further exploration provided

**Completed:** 2026-02-01

### Phase 14: Integration Testing & Validation

**Goal**: Validate workflow paths, gating behavior, and prevent regressions before release
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: (Integration testing spans all v1.1 requirements)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 14-01-PLAN.md — Create validation checklist and verification scripts
- [x] 14-02-PLAN.md — Verify REVISE_DATA routing, execute automated validation
- [x] 14-03-PLAN.md — Execute behavioral validation workflows (gap closure)

**Success Criteria:**
1. Progressive path works: quick-explore → full explore → architect proceeds without error
2. Insights path works: insights → architect proceeds without insufficient-data warning
3. Quick-only path triggers warning: quick-explore → architect warns about insufficient depth
4. Critic routing validated: research → REVISE_DATA → spawns full explore (not quick-explore)
5. Help documentation reflects all renamed commands and new commands

**Completed:** 2026-02-01

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Command cleanup before features: Clear debt, establish baseline
- Terminology rename after cleanup: New commands use new naming from start
- Quick before insights: Simpler feature validates architecture
- Integration testing last: Cannot test until all commands exist
- Inline Python formatting instead of Jinja2 templates: Simpler, maintainable
- Dual output strategy: DATA_REPORT.md (technical) + INSIGHTS_SUMMARY.md (plain English)

**Issues Resolved:**
- GSD-specific commands removed (audit-milestone, plan-milestone-gaps initially, then restored with study-centric naming)
- All 21 v1.1 requirements implemented and verified
- Behavioral validation workflows executed (SC-1, SC-2, SC-3 all passed)
- 118/118 automated verification checks passed

**Issues Deferred:**
- state.md template terminology (8 "Phase" references that should be "Study") — minor, not blocking
- explore.md placeholder syntax — minor, Explorer defaults to full mode anyway

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None critical — all deferred items are cosmetic
