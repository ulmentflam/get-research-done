### Phase 20: GSD Sync Setup & Exploration

**Goal**: Establish GSD upstream remote and identify features to cherry-pick
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of milestone)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 20-01: Add upstream remote, document features, create cherry-pick decisions

**Details:**
- Configured `gsd-upstream` remote pointing to upstream GSD repository
- Documented all 16 upstream commits since fork point
- Created cherry-pick decision matrix categorizing features into as-is, adapt, skip, and defer
- Identified Gemini CLI commit dependency chain for Phase 21

### Phase 21: Gemini CLI Integration

**Goal**: Cherry-pick Gemini CLI and selected features from GSD, adapt to GRD branding
**Depends on**: Phase 20 (need cherry-pick list and commit hashes)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 21-01: Cherry-pick universal improvements and Gemini support, adapt branding

**Details:**
- Cherry-picked 7 universal improvement commits (context bar scaling, ASCII box-drawing, etc.)
- Cherry-picked 2 Gemini-specific commits with full GRD branding adaptation
- Applied comprehensive branding sweep: gsd→grd, get-shit-done→get-research-done
- Installer now detects Gemini CLI and converts agents to TOML format
- npm test passes with all 23 tests

### Phase 22: Branding Updates

**Goal**: Update SVG/PNG assets to reflect GRD identity
**Depends on**: Nothing (can run parallel with Phase 21)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 22-01: Update logo SVG/PNG and terminal preview with GRD branding

**Details:**
- Created new GRD logo with ASCII art and research teal color palette (#4FB3D4)
- Updated terminal preview with `npx get-research-done` command and v1.3.0 title
- Generated PNG at 2000x2000 using Chrome headless
- Deleted old gsd-logo files
- Added CSS media queries for dark/light mode support

### Phase 23: Documentation & Finalization

**Goal**: Update all documentation to reflect v1.3 changes and any new features
**Depends on**: Phase 21, Phase 22 (need to document what was added)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:

**Details:**
- Added What's New in v1.3 section to README.md

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Cherry-pick with -X ours strategy for systematic branding changes
- sed-based branding transformation after merge
- Research teal color palette (#4FB3D4) on deep navy (#0a1628)
- Chrome headless for PNG generation (macOS native tools don't support SVG)
- CSS media queries for automatic dark/light mode switching
- What's New section placement after Getting Started in README

**Issues Resolved:**
- Git signing failure with 1Password (disabled GPG for session)
- Conflict resolution in bin/install.js and workflow files
- macOS SVG-to-PNG conversion (used Chrome headless)

**Issues Deferred:**
- Tech debt: package.json version mismatch (1.2.0 vs 1.3.0) — fix before npm publish
- Tech debt: Stray "gsd command" reference in progress.md line 363

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Agent prompt files still have some stale references (deferred from v1.2)
