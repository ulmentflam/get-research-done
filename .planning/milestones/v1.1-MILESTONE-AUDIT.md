# v1.1 Milestone Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.1 Research UX Refinement
**Audited:** 2026-02-01T19:30:00Z
**Status:** GAPS FOUND

## Executive Summary

v1.1 milestone implementation is **structurally complete** (95% wiring verified) but **behaviorally unvalidated** (3/4 E2E flows not executed). All 21 requirements have been addressed, but 2 have verification gaps that block sign-off.

**Key findings:**
- Command cleanup and terminology rename: Complete
- Quick explore and insights features: Implemented, wiring verified, workflow not executed
- Integration testing: Infrastructure created, manual scenarios not run
- Critical gap: Phase 14 success criteria require workflow execution, not just structural checks

### Quick Explore (5/5 Implemented, Workflow Not Executed)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| QUICK-01: Create /grd:quick-explore command | ✓ SATISFIED | quick-explore.md (231 lines) |
| QUICK-02: Execute analysis in <60 seconds | ⚠️ UNVERIFIED | Logic exists, not timed in production |

### Accessible Insights (5/5 Implemented, Workflow Not Executed)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| INSIGHT-01: Create /grd:insights command | ✓ SATISFIED | insights.md (239 lines) |
| INSIGHT-02: Generate technical DATA_REPORT.md | ✓ SATISFIED | data_report.md.j2 template |
| INSIGHT-03: Generate plain English summary | ✓ SATISFIED | "What This Means" in insights_summary.md.j2 |
| INSIGHT-04: Provide actionable recommendations | ✓ SATISFIED | generate_recommendations() function |

## Phase Status

| Phase | Status | Score | Critical Gap |
|-------|--------|-------|--------------|
| 10. Command Cleanup | ✓ PASSED | 4/4 | None |
| 11. Terminology Rename | ⚠️ GAPS | 4/5 | state.md template terminology |
| 12. Quick Explore | ✓ PASSED | 5/5 | None (structural) |
| 13. Accessible Insights | ✓ PASSED | 5/5 | None (structural) |
| 14. Integration Testing | ⚠️ GAPS | 2/5 | Manual scenarios not executed |

## Integration Check Results

**Automated verification:** 118/118 checks PASS
- audit-help-commands.sh: 17/17 pass
- verify-revise-data-routing.sh: 8/8 pass
- verify-all-commands.sh: 93/93 pass

**Cross-phase wiring:** 95% complete (18/19 connections)
- Phase 10 → Phase 11 study lifecycle: ✓ Wired
- Phase 11 → help.md, agents, workflows: ✓ Wired
- Phase 12 → Explorer → quick.py → formatters.py: ✓ Wired
- Phase 13 → Explorer → insights.py → templates: ✓ Wired
- Architect → DATA_REPORT.md mode detection: ✓ Wired
- REVISE_DATA → Explorer full mode: ✓ Verified

## End-to-End Flows

| Flow | Status | Blocking Issue |
|------|--------|----------------|
| REVISE_DATA routing | ✓ VERIFIED | None (automated script verified) |
| Progressive path (quick → full → architect) | ✗ NOT RUN | SC-1 in VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md not executed |
| Insights path (insights → architect) | ✗ NOT RUN | SC-2 in VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md not executed |
| Quick-only warning (quick → architect) | ✗ NOT RUN | SC-3 in VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md not executed |

## Gaps Summary

### Critical Blockers (3)

1. **SC-1 Progressive Path Not Executed**
   - Success criterion: "Progressive path works: quick-explore → full explore → architect proceeds without error"
   - Status: Workflow infrastructure exists, not executed
   - Impact: Cannot confirm quick-explore transitions correctly to full explore

2. **SC-2 Insights Path Not Executed**
   - Success criterion: "Insights path works: insights → architect proceeds without insufficient-data warning"
   - Status: Workflow infrastructure exists, not executed
   - Impact: Cannot confirm architect accepts insights-based DATA_REPORT.md

3. **SC-3 Quick-Only Warning Not Executed**
   - Success criterion: "Quick-only path triggers warning: quick-explore → architect warns about insufficient depth"
   - Status: Warning logic exists in code, not observed in production
   - Impact: Cannot confirm architect actually displays warning

### Non-Critical Tech Debt (2)

1. **state.md Template Terminology** (Phase 11)
   - 8 instances of "Phase" that should be "Study"
   - Impact: Generated STATE.md files will use inconsistent terminology
   - Effort: ~15 minutes to fix

2. **explore.md Placeholder Syntax** (Phase 14)
   - Line 100-105: `[quick | detailed]` placeholder not substituted
   - Impact: Minor - Explorer defaults to full mode anyway
   - Effort: ~5 minutes to fix

## Recommendations

### To Close Gaps (Required for v1.1 Sign-off)

**Option A: Execute Manual Scenarios (~45 min)**

Run the 3 manual scenarios from `.planning/phases/14-integration-testing-validation/VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md`:

1. **SC-1:** Run `/grd:quick-explore`, then `/grd:explore`, then `/grd:architect` — verify no warning
2. **SC-2:** Run `/grd:insights`, then `/grd:architect` — verify no warning
3. **SC-3:** Run `/grd:quick-explore`, then `/grd:architect` (skip full explore) — verify warning displays

Update `VALIDATION_RESULTS.md` with execution evidence.

**Option B: Accept Gaps and Complete Anyway**

If schedule pressure prevents manual testing, run `/gsd:complete-milestone v1.1` with known gaps. Track as technical debt for v1.2.

### To Reduce Tech Debt (Optional)

1. Fix state.md template terminology — `/grd:plan-study-gaps`
2. Fix explore.md placeholder — quick edit
