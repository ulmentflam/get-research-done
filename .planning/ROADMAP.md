### 📋 v2.0 Advanced Features (Planned)

**Milestone Goal:** MLflow integration, DVC integration, multi-user support, web UI, red-teaming mode, automatic data profiling

**Phases:** 15+ (to be defined via `/grd:new-study`)

**Potential features:**
- MLflow experiment tracking integration
- DVC data versioning
- Multi-user support with shared experiment registry
- Web UI for experiment visualization
- Red-teaming mode for Critic (adversarial validation)
- Automatic data profiling with statistical tests
- Visual previews (ASCII charts, embedded images)
- Confidence indicators in plain language
