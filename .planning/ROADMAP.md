<summary>v1.2 Command Unification (Phases 15-19) - SHIPPED 2026-02-02</summary>

**Milestone Goal:** Transform all lifecycle commands from software-dev terminology (phases, milestones, roadmaps) to research-native terminology (experiments, studies, protocols) with correct command chaining.

**Phases completed:** 15-19 (12 plans total)

- [x] Phase 15: Command Renames (4/4 plans) - completed 2026-02-02
- [x] Phase 16: Command Chaining Fixes (2/2 plans) - completed 2026-02-02
