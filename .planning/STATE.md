# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-27)

**Core value:** Structured ML experimentation with scientific rigor — from hypothesis to validated conclusion, with a Critic agent enforcing skepticism at every step

**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Core Orchestration & Branding

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Core Orchestration & Branding)
Plan: 4 of 6 (01-01, 01-02, 01-03, 01-04 completed)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-28 — Completed 01-04-PLAN.md (Hook references and build scripts)

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 40%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 1.8 min
- Total execution time: 0.12 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 4 | 7.2min | 1.8min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-04 (1.2min), 01-03 (1min), 01-02 (2min), 01-01 (3min)
- Trend: Improving efficiency

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Decision | Made In | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Use git mv for all renames to preserve file history | 01-01 | All directory and file renames tracked in git history |
| Rename directories and files before updating content | 01-01 | Structural changes complete before textual content updates |
| Preserve directory/package names during rebranding | 01-02 | Technical identifiers (get-shit-done paths, get-shit-done-cc package) stay unchanged until later plans update them |
| Use Unicode box-drawing for GRD ASCII art | 01-02 | Terminal branding pattern: filled-in block letters with cyan color |

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**From Research:**
- Phase 4 complexity: Critic decision logic (rules vs LLM-powered reasoning) needs prototyping during planning
- Phase 4 risk: Infinite recursive loops — maximum iteration depth and escape hatches required
- Phase 5 integration: Technology versions (MLflow 2.9.x, DVC 3.x, uv stability) need verification at planning time
