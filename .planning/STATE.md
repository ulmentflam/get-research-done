# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-30)

**Core value:** Structured ML experimentation with scientific rigor — from hypothesis to validated conclusion, with a Critic agent enforcing skepticism at every step.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log archived in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent v1.1 context:
- Command cleanup before features: Clear debt, establish baseline
- Terminology rename after cleanup: New commands use new naming from start
- Quick before insights: Simpler feature validates architecture
- Integration testing last: Cannot test until all commands exist

### Terminology Mapping (Study-Centric)

| Current | New | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| `new-milestone` | `new-study` | Start a new research study |
| `complete-milestone` | `complete-study` | Archive and conclude a study |
| `discuss-phase` | `scope-study` | Scope the research approach |
| `plan-phase` | `plan-study` | Plan the research execution |
| `execute-phase` | `run-study` | Execute the research plan |
| `verify-work` | `validate-study` | Validate research results |

**Core research commands unchanged:** `explore`, `architect`, `research`, `evaluate`, `graduate`

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet. Phase 10 ready to plan.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-30
Stopped at: v1.1 roadmap created, Phase 10 ready for planning
Resume file: None

Next step: Run `/grd:plan-phase 10` to create execution plan for Command Cleanup & Foundation
