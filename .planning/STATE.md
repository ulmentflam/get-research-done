# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-30)

**Core value:** Structured ML experimentation with scientific rigor — from hypothesis to validated conclusion, with a Critic agent enforcing skepticism at every step.

**Current focus:** Phase 10 - Command Cleanup & Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 10 of 14 (Command Cleanup & Foundation)
Plan: 01 of 01
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-01-30 — Completed 10-01-PLAN.md (command cleanup)

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 20% (v1.1: 1/5 phases complete)

## Milestone History

| Version | Name | Phases | Shipped |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| v1.0 | GRD MVP | 1-9 (39 plans) | 2026-01-30 |
| v1.1 | Research UX Refinement | 10-14 (in progress) | - |

## Performance Metrics

**v1.0 Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 39
- Average duration: 2.9 min
- Total execution time: 1.9 hours
- Timeline: 47 days (project start to ship)

**v1.1 Progress:**
- Phases: 1/5 complete
- Plans: 1/1 complete
- Average duration: 1.0 min

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log archived in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent v1.1 context:
- Command cleanup before features: Clear debt, establish baseline
- Terminology rename after cleanup: New commands use new naming from start
- Quick before insights: Simpler feature validates architecture
- Integration testing last: Cannot test until all commands exist
- .claude/ directory is gitignored: Command files are local-only (not version-controlled)
- 30 command baseline established: audit-milestone and plan-milestone-gaps removed (GSD-specific)

### Terminology Mapping (Study-Centric)

| Current | New | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| `new-milestone` | `new-study` | Start a new research study |
| `complete-milestone` | `complete-study` | Archive and conclude a study |
| `discuss-phase` | `scope-study` | Scope the research approach |
| `plan-phase` | `plan-study` | Plan the research execution |
| `execute-phase` | `run-study` | Execute the research plan |
| `verify-work` | `validate-study` | Validate research results |

**Core research commands unchanged:** `explore`, `architect`, `research`, `evaluate`, `graduate`

### Blockers/Concerns

None. Phase 10 complete, ready for Phase 11 (terminology rename).

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-30
Stopped at: Completed Phase 10 (Command Cleanup & Foundation)
Resume file: None

Next step: Run `/grd:plan-phase 11` to create execution plan for Terminology Rename
