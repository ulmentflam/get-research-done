# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core value:** Structured ML experimentation with scientific rigor — from hypothesis to validated conclusion, with a Critic agent enforcing skepticism at every step

**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Core Orchestration & Branding

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Core Orchestration & Branding)
Plan: Ready to plan
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-01-27 — Roadmap and state initialized

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- No decisions logged yet — project just initialized

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**From Research:**
- Phase 4 complexity: Critic decision logic (rules vs LLM-powered reasoning) needs prototyping during planning
- Phase 4 risk: Infinite recursive loops — maximum iteration depth and escape hatches required
- Phase 5 integration: Technology versions (MLflow 2.9.x, DVC 3.x, uv stability) need verification at planning time
