## Tech Debt

### HIGH Priority

**1. package.json version mismatch**
- Location: package.json
- Issue: Shows "1.2.0" but should be "1.3.0"
- Impact: Version mismatch between installer and docs
- Fix: Update version field before npm publish

### LOW Priority

**2. Stray GSD reference**
- Location: commands/grd/progress.md line 363
- Issue: "gsd command" should be "grd command"
- Impact: Minor branding inconsistency in internal text
- Fix: Find/replace gsd→grd

## Anti-Patterns Scanned

| Phase | TODOs | FIXMEs | Placeholders | Stubs |
|-------|-------|--------|--------------|-------|
| 20 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 21 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

## Audit Conclusion

**v1.3 is ready for release** with the following pre-release tasks:
