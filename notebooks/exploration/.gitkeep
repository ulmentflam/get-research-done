# Exploration Notebooks

This directory contains exploratory Jupyter notebooks.

## Conventions

- Number notebooks sequentially: 001_initial_test.ipynb, 002_revised_method.ipynb
- Organize subdirectories at your discretion
- Notebooks here run through GRD validation loop via /grd:research
- On Critic PROCEED verdict, graduate notebooks to src/experiments/ using /grd:graduate

## Graduation Requirements

- Random seed must be explicitly set (numpy, torch, random, etc.)
- Cell tagged 'parameters' for parameterization (encouraged but not required)
- Hardcoded paths: advisory warning (doesn't block graduation)

## Notebook Execution

- Fresh kernel for every run (reproducibility over speed)
- Cell-level timeout to catch infinite loops
- Both executed notebook AND extracted outputs saved to experiments/run_NNN/

## After Graduation

Original notebooks stay here after graduation (not archived/deleted).
Graduated scripts land in src/experiments/ with header referencing source notebook.
