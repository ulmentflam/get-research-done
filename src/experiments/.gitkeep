# Validated Experiments

This directory contains graduated Python scripts from exploration notebooks.

## How Scripts Arrive Here

1. Notebook runs through GRD validation loop (/grd:research)
2. Critic returns PROCEED verdict
3. User graduates notebook via /grd:graduate
4. nbconvert creates .py file, template adds metadata header

## Script Requirements

- Self-contained: runs without notebook dependencies
- Parameterized: argparse CLI arguments
- Reproducible: explicit random seeds
- Tested: core functions have tests (recommended)

## Traceability

Each script header references its source notebook:

```python
"""
Validated experiment: My Experiment

Source notebook: notebooks/exploration/001_initial.ipynb
Source run: experiments/run_003_baseline
Critic verdict: PROCEED (2026-01-30)
Graduated: 2026-01-30T12:00:00Z
"""
```

## Refactoring Checklist

Graduated scripts include a checklist for manual completion:

- [ ] Remove/convert magic commands (grep "^%")
- [ ] Extract code into functions
- [ ] Replace parameter cell with argparse
- [ ] Add docstrings and type hints
- [ ] Set all random seeds explicitly
- [ ] Write tests for core functions

## Running Validated Scripts

```bash
# Run with default parameters
python src/experiments/my_experiment.py

# Run with custom parameters
python src/experiments/my_experiment.py --random-seed 123 --learning-rate 0.001
```
